# ft_printf
ft_printf is one of the three projects you have to complete in this circle, it is basically a recreation of the function printf,  where you want it to print out certain parameters based on their data types. It includes variadic functions (va_list), your very own printf function (ft_printf.c), and other functions that might help with this project! (Libft can be used here!)
