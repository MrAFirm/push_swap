# libft
My own progress on libft.

If you're unfamiliar, it's a Cadet's very first project on the 42 school's main cursus in the Core Programme, where you create your very own C library to be used in future projects.

It consists of Makefile, libft.h, and all your .c files which contain set functions.

Feel free to use this as reference code, but if you really decide to copy and paste the whole thing, then what are you actually here for?
